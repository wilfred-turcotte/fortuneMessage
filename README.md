# Fortune Teller

### A Mixed Messages project for Codecademy.com

## Description

My submission for the Full Stack developer project 'Mixed Messages' themed as a fortune teller that provides a randomly generated fortune message from a three part JS array.

"For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking." 

## Features

Output messages made up of at least three different pieces of data to the user.
